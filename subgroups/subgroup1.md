# A fresh look at FAIR for Research Software

**Subgroup 1**

**Lead**: Daniel S. Katz

## Description
This subgroup, "A fresh look at FAIR for Research Software," will examine the FAIR principles in the context of research software. A group of people, many of whom are involved in the FAIR4RS WG, previously developed a position paper “Towards FAIR principles for research software” aimed at developing a set of FAIR principles for research software. This subgroup is intended to take a fresh look at the same problem, and thus should not include authors of that paper; it would be best if the members of this subgroup initially avoid studying that paper so that this work is "fresh".

The [FAIR principles](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples), originally created for data, have 4 foundational principles (F, A, I, R)  and 15 guiding principles grouped under the foundational principles that are intended to accomplish them. This group's charge is:
1. Determine what part of the FAIR principles apply as is to research software.
2. Determine what part of the FAIR principles doesn't apply at all to research software.
3. Determine what part of the FAIR principles applies to research software, but with a different definition or different details.

## Zotero
If needed, we will use the [FAIR4RS Zotero Group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2501020/fair4rs)

## Output
A new list of FAIR principles for research software, based on the list of FAIR data principles.
