# FAIR work in other contexts

**Subgroup 2**

**Lead**: Michelle Barker

## Description
There has been an ongoing effort to apply FAIR principles to different forms of research software used in various ways and contexts. Examples are:
- Workflows (eg. [FAIR workflows by Goble et al.](https://doi.org/10.1162/dint_a_00033))
- Computational notebooks (eg. [FAIR for notebooks](https://coffeehouse.dataone.org/2019/12/19/managing-computational-notebooks-an-overview-of-chopportunities/) by [Herterich](https://coffeehouse.dataone.org/author/patricia-herterich/))
- Research objects (eg. [FAIR for research objects](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2019.03.046) by Garcia-Silva et al.)
- Training materials (eg. [10 simple rules for making training materials FAIR](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007854) by Garcia et al.)

These different applications pose different challenges and requirements. The task of this subgroup is to look into and make an overview of the commonalities and differences between the different use cases. The resulting overview will provide useful insights for the definition of FAIR principles for research software and the guidelines for their implementation.

## Output
1. An overview of FAIR use cases applied to other contexts
2. The list of commonalities, the differences and challenges in applying FAIR principles

## Zotero
Relevant literature will be added to the [FAIR4RS Zotero Group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2501020/fair4rs)
Please use `FAIR other contexts` tag for resources relevant for this subgroup.

We are making an inventory of examples of FAIR principles applied to different forms of research software used in various ways and contexts in the [Working Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n1r-EaF5Oqy40BlHe-VL0AggTOS8vMcD22VHQmd7O-M/edit?usp=sharing).
