# Review of new research related to FAIR Software

**Subgroup 4**

**Lead**: Neil Chue Hong

## Description
This subgroup will review new research around FAIR software that has come out since the release of the [Towards FAIR principles for research software](https://content.iospress.com/articles/data-science/ds190026) paper.

The aims of this group are:
1. Conduct a desk review to identify new papers, reports, workshops, etc. which are related to FAIR software since August 2019
Read the [Towards FAIR principles for research software](https://content.iospress.com/articles/data-science/ds190026) paper and the new outputs, and decide whether they are relevant to the work of the FAIR4RS WG
2. Summarise the lessons learned from this work
3. Add relevant outputs to the [FAIR4RS Zotero Group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2501020/fair4rs)
4. Determine how these insights can be included in the definition and application of FAIR principles for research software

Potential work to review includes:
- From [FAIR research data toward FAIR and open research software](https://doi.org/10.1515/itit-2019-0040).
- Papers in the [Data Intelligence special issue on FAIR](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/toc/dint/2/1-2).

Suggested [FAIR4RS Zotero Group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2501020/fair4rs) tag: `Recent Work`

_**Note**_: https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/dint_r_00024 defines _foundational principles_ (F,A,I,R) versus _guiding principles_ (F1, F2, etc) and we should reuse this terminology as we assess what might need to be changed / adapted.


## Output

What new lessons have been learnt from these papers and workshops? Has anything changed in the interim.
